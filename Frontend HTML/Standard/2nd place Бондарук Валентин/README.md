DEV Challenge (first fight)
======================

Webapp based on Html/Css, without JavaScript.

Getting Started
===============

1. Do `npm install` in src folder.
2. Start app with `npm start`.
3. Point your browser to http://localhost:8080 to check if the app works.

P.S. 

## For testing please use the next links:

- Qualification page http://localhost:8080
- Evaluation page http://localhost:8080/evaluation.html


For current demonstration :active and :hover css states are used for
all effects including slider and other interactive elements.
But, for real project need to use JS for such implementations.
